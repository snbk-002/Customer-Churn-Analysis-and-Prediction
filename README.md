## Customer-Churn-Analysis

### Overview:

This project provides an end-to-end solution for analyzing customer churn of Telecom Industry using Python. Churn analysis is critical for understanding why customers leave a business and helps in designing strategies to retain them.

### Key Features:

1.Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveils patterns and trends with visualizations.

3.Feature Engineering: Transforms raw data into actionable features.

4.Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, PCA) to predict customer churn.

5.Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.

6.Insights and Recommendations: Derives actionable insights to improve customer retention.

### Technologies Used:

->Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imblearn

->Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

->Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-learn

### Project Highlights:

A clean and modular codebase for easy reproducibility.

Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step documentation of the analysis.

Ready-to-use datasets for replicating the analysis.

### Key drivers that influence churn:

1. Handset loss/Upgrade
   
2. Network Quality
   
3. Competitive Pricing
   
4. Customer Care Quality


###  Insights:


1. Factors like *Gender*, *Availability of PhoneService* and *No of multiple lines* have alomost *NO* impact on Churn.

2. *LOW* Churn is seens in case of *Long term contracts*, *Subscriptions without internet service* and *The customers engaged for 5+ years*
