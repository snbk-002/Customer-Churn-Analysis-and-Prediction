# Customer-Churn-Analysis

### Overview:

This project provides an end-to-end solution for analyzing customer churn using Python. Churn analysis is critical for understanding why customers leave a business and helps in designing strategies to retain them.

#### Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveils patterns and trends with visualizations.

Feature Engineering: Transforms raw data into actionable features.

Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn.

Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.

Insights and Recommendations: Derives actionable insights to improve customer retention.

### Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imblearn

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-learn

### Project Highlights:

A clean and modular codebase for easy reproducibility.

Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step documentation of the analysis.

Ready-to-use datasets for replicating the analysis.

### Key Insights:

1. Electronic check medium are the highest churners.
   
2. Contract Type - Monthly customers are more likely to churn because of no contract terms, as they are free to go customers.
   
3. No Online security, No Tech Support category are high churners.
   
4. Non senior Citizens are high churners

5. Factors like *Gender*, *Availability of PhoneService* and *No of multiple lines* have alomost *NO* impact on Churn.

6. *LOW* Churn is seens in case of *Long term contracts*, *Subscriptions without internet service* and *The customers engaged for 5+ years*
